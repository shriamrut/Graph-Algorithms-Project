The topological sort of the first graph is: 
Vertex    Number
A         1
B         2
C         5
D         4
E         3
F         7
G         6

For the second graph
Shortest Path from A to A (distance = 0 )
Shortest Path from A to B (distance = 2 )
Shortest Path from A to C (distance = 3 )
Shortest Path from A to D (distance = 1 )
Shortest Path from A to E (distance = 3 )
Shortest Path from A to F (distance = 6 )
Shortest Path from A to G (distance = 5 )

The edges in MSP for graph 3 are 
(A,D) (F,G) (A,B) (C,D) (D,G) (E,G) 
Its cost is 16
